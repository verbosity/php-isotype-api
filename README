very initial readme.
Please note this readme is intended for a future commit, the code is as yet not this functional.

php-isotype-api
------------------
these file(s) allow the creation of sag images in the isotope style (also known as the Vienna or Warsaw methods)

installation
--------------
place the file(s) where they can be accessed by a web server,
additional options are listed below

options
---------
either run
isotype_form.php to access a fully functional form 

or you can pass variables through either post or get directly to the isotype.php file
eg www.myurl/isotype.php?icon=man&colour=blue

current variables
---
icon =
colour = 

for americans the use of the command color can be used instead of colour, though if both are used colour will take prescience.

single colours can be either html allows 'named' colours or by use of hex please do not use the #)

Available icon choices are listed in the file, but if you can't read php they are as follows:
man
woman
baby
house
pound
euro
ambulance
bed
old
hospital
beer
bus

additional paths can be added 
Please note POST is given preference to GET
some options can be restricted in the options.cfg file (for instance allowing only get or vice versa)

Goals / future versions & TODO's
------------------------------------
As the php isotope api currently exists its a mass on non functional code, 
goals are as follows
0. fix current code
0(b). allow for basic settings in a cfg file
1. multiple colours per icon
2. multiple sets of similar icons in a grid layout
3. complex colour options over multiple icons
4. additional layout options
5. multiple icon layouts using differing icons (for say a family)
